          <p>Born in Singapore, I have grown up loving physics, mathematics, and then fallen in love with programming later on in life.
            To me, they are the manifestation of elegance of the universe; they are unambiguous yet complex, logical yet magical; they
            are rules inevitably made or explained by man and are of instructional nature, yet with them, men are capable of infinite creations.

            Learning about programming has lead me to a new path of possibilites where I can start using skills picked up on my way learning about the world
            through physics and mathematics, to learn the myriad of immerging technologies that are often mind-blowing, and to create things that are useful, write codes that I am proud of. I am a software developer, and happily one. Learn more about my work and my experiences below.
